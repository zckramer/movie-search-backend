# movie-search-backend
This API has a front-end. 
Here's the link: https://github.com/zckramer/movie-search-frontend/tree/master

The front end can be accessed by default at localhost 3000

Movie Search 3k! 
This requires the API running on localhost:9000 

You will probably have to npm install for both front and back-ends.

Tech Stack: I used create-react-app for the front-end, and express-generator for the back-end. The database is mongoDB.
